This is how my education started with the Programming basics course in SoftUni!

This course gave me basic coding skills using Java and how to use IDE.
Here we started to study about data types and variables, conditional statements,
nested conditional statements, loops, nested loops, how to debug code,
how to work with console.


And this is my certificate from this course.
