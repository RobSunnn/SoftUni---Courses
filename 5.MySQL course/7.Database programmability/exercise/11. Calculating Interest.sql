/* P11 - Calculating Interest
Your task is to create a stored procedure usp_calculate_future_value_for_account 
that accepts as parameters â€“ id of account and interest rate. 
The procedure uses the function from the previous problem to give an interest to a 
person's account for 5 years, along with information about his/her account id, 
first name, last name and current balance as it is shown in the example below. 
It should take the account_id and the interest_rate as parameters. 
Interest rate should have precision up to 0.0001, same as the calculated balance 
after 5 years. Be extremely careful to achieve the desired precision!   */
